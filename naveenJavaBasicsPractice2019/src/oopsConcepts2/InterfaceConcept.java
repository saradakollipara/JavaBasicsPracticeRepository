	//Multiple inheritance is possible through Interface
	//Only method declaration is done in an interface
	//no method body - only method prototype
	//we can declare the variables in an interface, by default the variable are static
	//Variable value will not be changed mean that it is final
	//no static method in interface - coz they are part of oops and static methods are not allowed in oops
	// NO main method in Interface
	//Interface is abstract in nature
	//it is also called as is-a relationship
	//we have to override all the methods of the interface in the class it implements
	
	//implements keyword is used to inherit an interface in a child class
	// we can not create object to an interface
	
	
	//Always define only Abstract methods in an interface
	//only method declaration
	//100% abstraction is achieved with Interface
	// no need to give abstract keyword in declaring the interface class methods by default they are abstract 
	//only final and static variables are defined in Interface 
	 // If you want to use 100% abstraction use Interface i.e., hide full implementation logic
